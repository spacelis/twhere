# TWhere

This package provides tools for predicting users future visits based on CF and the algorithms can be found in exprmodels.py.

There are two scripts for running the experiments: exprrunner.py and runner2.py and the latter are more multiprocessor friendly.
As runner2.py requires long configurations, two configuring scripts are provided: anexpr.py and guianexpr.py and the latter is based on the former.
The default config can be found in config.py.

For evaluating the algorithms designed for predicting users' future visits, a script called evalres.py is provided, and another script called evalsig.py is used for wilcoxon tests.
A auxiliary script concentrate.py is provide to combine the outputs from all the folds of experiments.
